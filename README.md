# SPoT (Core Data)

This is my work on the SPoT project from Assignment 6 of Stanford University's [Coding Together](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016) course.

To run this code yourself you must obtain your own Flickr API key and set the key using the `FlickrAPIKey` macro found in `SPoT/FlickrFetcher/FlickrAPIKey.h`.
